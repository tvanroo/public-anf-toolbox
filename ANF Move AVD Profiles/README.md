# Download Script:
[ANF Move AVD Profiles](https://github.com/tvanroo/public-anf-toolbox/blob/main/ANF%20Move%20AVD%20Profiles/ANF-Move-AVD-Profiles.ps1)
    - Migrates FSLogix AVD (Azure Virtual Desktop) profiles from existing SMB shares to Azure NetApp Files SMB shares with intelligent conflict resolution and profile-in-use detection. Result: Safe migration of user profiles with minimal downtime and data integrity protection.

## Script Purpose
This script is specifically designed as a **final cutover tool** for migrating FSLogix profiles from legacy SMB file shares to Azure NetApp Files (ANF) SMB shares in Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) environments. It performs intelligent file synchronization with conflict resolution and automatically detects profiles that are currently in use to prevent data corruption.

## Key Features
- **Intelligent File Comparison**: Compares creation and modification dates to resolve conflicts intelligently
- **Profile-in-Use Detection**: Automatically skips profiles that contain `.metadata` files (indicating active use)
- **BITS Transfer Technology**: Uses Background Intelligent Transfer Service for efficient file transfers
- **Conflict Resolution Logic**: 
  - Overwrites destination files only if source files are more recently modified
  - Preserves newer profiles and prevents overwriting with older versions
  - Skips profiles with conflicting creation dates for manual resolution
- **Transfer Speed Monitoring**: Displays transfer speeds in MiB/s for performance monitoring
- **Cleanup Operations**: Automatically removes source files and empty directories after successful transfers
- **Selective Migration**: Supports filtering specific profiles using configurable filter strings

## Migration Logic
The script follows this intelligent decision tree for each file:

1. **Check Profile Usage**: Skip entire profile if `.metadata` file exists (profile in use)
2. **File Existence Check**: 
   - If destination file doesn't exist ‚Üí Copy and delete source
   - If destination file exists ‚Üí Apply conflict resolution logic
3. **Conflict Resolution** (when destination exists):
   - If creation times match AND source is newer ‚Üí Overwrite destination
   - If creation times match AND destination is newer/same ‚Üí Skip overwrite, delete source
   - If creation times differ ‚Üí Skip for manual resolution (prevents empty profile overwrites)

## Configuration Variables
```powershell
$SourcePath = "\\old-fileserver.domain.com\profiles"        # Source SMB share path
$DestinationPath = "\\ANF-server.domain.com\anf-profiles"   # ANF SMB share path  
$FilterString = "username-filter"                           # Optional filter for specific users
```

## Prerequisites
- **Dual Path Configuration**: Both old and new SMB paths should be configured in FSLogix settings
- **Administrative Access**: Script must run with permissions to both source and destination shares
- **BITS Service**: Background Intelligent Transfer Service must be available
- **Network Connectivity**: Reliable network connection between source and ANF destination
- **Testing**: Always test with non-production data first

## Usage Scenarios

### **Primary Use Case: Final Cutover Migration**
- Configure FSLogix with both old and new paths (old path as primary)
- Run script during maintenance window when users are logged off
- Profiles get migrated and will automatically use new ANF path on next login

### **Selective User Migration**
- Use `$FilterString` to migrate specific users or user groups
- Useful for phased migrations or troubleshooting specific profiles

### **Cleanup Operations**  
- Remove migrated data from legacy storage
- Consolidate profiles from multiple legacy shares

## Safety Features
- **Read-Only Mode**: Commented transfer and deletion commands for testing
- **Profile Lock Detection**: Automatically skips profiles with active `.metadata` files
- **Conflict Logging**: Clear console output showing all actions taken
- **Preservation Logic**: Prevents overwriting newer profiles with older versions
- **Manual Resolution Flags**: Identifies conflicts requiring administrator attention

## Output Messages
- **üü¢ Green**: Successful file copies and updates with transfer speeds
- **üü° Yellow**: File deletions and conflicts requiring manual resolution  
- **‚ö™ White**: Skipped files with reasoning
- **üîò Gray**: Filtered or in-use profiles that were skipped

## Migration Best Practices
1. **Test First**: Always test with non-critical profiles in a lab environment
2. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure reliable backups of source profiles before migration
3. **Maintenance Windows**: Run during off-hours when users are not logged in
4. **Phased Approach**: Consider migrating users in batches using filter strings
5. **Monitor Performance**: Watch transfer speeds and adjust timing accordingly
6. **Validate Results**: Confirm successful profile access after migration

## FSLogix Integration Notes
- Designed to work with FSLogix multi-path configurations
- Supports Profile Container and Office Container scenarios  
- Compatible with both user profiles and application data
- Maintains NTFS permissions and ACLs during transfer
- Preserves file timestamps and metadata

## Troubleshooting
- **Slow Transfers**: Check network bandwidth between source and ANF
- **Permission Errors**: Verify service account has full access to both shares
- **Profile Corruption**: Review conflict resolution logs for manual intervention needs
- **BITS Errors**: Ensure BITS service is running and properly configured

## Important Notes
- This is a **destructive operation** - source files are deleted after successful transfer
- Always uncomment the actual transfer and deletion commands only after thorough testing
- The script includes safety comments (`############################`) around critical operations
- Manual resolution is required for profiles with conflicting creation dates
- Profiles currently in use (with `.metadata` files) are automatically protected
